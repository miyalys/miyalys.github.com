Some older and some newer configs and scripts.  
Let me know if you have ideas for improvements, corrections or if you think something is missing - thanks! :-)

For WM's I've mostly been switching between tiling wms like i3, awesome, dwm and xmonad, 
and for bars i've used xmobar and i3bar.  
Since I've been switching WM's I'm trying to take as much configuration out of the WM as possible (fx. hotkeys), 
so most still works if I switch again.

I generally strive to write my scripts POSIX compliant, with sh as the shell, so they can run with `dash` as it uses
less resources.

I've left most comments in as they may be helpful to some of you.
