// Set round timers to 1 (min.) so they basically end as early as possible, so one doesn't have to look at that constant decrementing number. Instead it reaches 0 and stops with mp_ignore_round_win_conditions enabled. 
// (Max is 60.000000 but I assume those zeroes make no difference) Not necessary when warmup is infinite though, unless deciding to end warmup.

// Don't do damage to bots or self?:
